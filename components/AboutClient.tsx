        About Me
      </h1>

      <p>
        I am a registered and accredited counsellor (MNCPS Acc.) committed to
        providing a safe, confidential, and empowering therapeutic space.
      </p>

      <p>
        My approach is warm, collaborative, and person-centred, ensuring every
        session supports your emotional wellbeing, resilience, and personal
        growth.
      </p>

      <p>
        I work with individuals and couples across a wide range of emotional and
        relational challenges including anxiety, stress, trauma, depression,
        relationship conflict, communication difficulties, and self-esteem.
      </p>

      <p>
        You deserve to feel heard, supported, and understood — and therapy can
        help you move towards balance, clarity, and emotional peace.
